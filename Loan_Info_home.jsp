				      <p>Millions of urban Indians today use home loans to buy the homes of their dreams. But not everybody is familiar with the house loan procedure. As a result, many loan requests are turned down, or borrowers find themselves in a difficult situation because they are unable to pay off their obligations. 


In essence, a house loan is a sum of money granted to people by banks or Housing Finance Companies (HFC) in exchange for an Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI). The sum disbursed allows the homebuyer to purchase the property, but the asset remains the bankâ€™s security until the loan is fully returned. 

</p>
				      <b>Home loan process </b> <br>
<p>An official application to the bank is the first step in the process for a house loan. Additionally, the bank needs your personal information to review and determine your loan eligibility. Typically, banks will require the following paperwork:</p>
<pre>
  1. Identity proof
  2.Address Proof
  3.Age proof
  4.Proof of educational
  5.Employment details
  6.Proof of income
  7.Pan Card
  8.Property details
